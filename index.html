                <p>NASA astronaut Frank Rubio and two Russian crewmates parachuted to a landing on the remote steppe of Kazakhstan on Wednesday, capping a 371-day mission at the International Space Station, the longest single spaceflight ever undertaken by an American.</p>
                <p>It was also the third-longest mission off the planet in the history of human spaceflight, eclipsed only by two Russian cosmonauts who lived on the Mir space station in the 1990s.</p>
                <p>Rubio, a US Army lieutenant colonel who grew up in El Salvador and Miami, was supposed to spend about six months in low-Earth orbit on the International Space Station. He launched on September 21, 2022, on a Russian Soyuz spacecraft with commander Sergey Prokopyev and flight engineer Dmitri Petelin.</p>

                <h2>Hugs in Houston</h2>
                <p>Rubio's mission spanned 5,936 orbits of the Earth and covered more than 157 million miles (253 million kilometers). He was expected to board a NASA jet in Kazakhstan for the flight back to Houston, where he will reunite with his family.</p>
                <p>“Hugging my wife and kids is going to be paramount, and I’ll probably focus on that for the first couple of days," Rubio said. He added that he's looking forward to the "peace and quiet" of his backyard. "Up here, we kind of have the constant hum of machinery that’s keeping us alive.”</p>
                <p>Like Petelin, this was Rubio's first flight to space. Rubio was an Army physician and a UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter pilot before NASA selected him to join the agency's astronaut corps in 2017. His medical training gave him an idea of what to expect as he re-adapts to Earth's gravity after floating around in orbit for more than a year.</p>
